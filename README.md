# Parkinson's Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project for detecting Parkinson's Disease using data from a Kaggle dataset. The project is implemented in **Google Colab** and aims to predict the presence of Parkinson's Disease based on various features related to speech and medical tests.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Parkinson's Disease Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishpatel26/parkinsons-disease-detection)
- **Description**: The dataset consists of various medical and speech-related features such as jitter, shimmer, and other voice-based characteristics that can be used to predict the presence of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease.
- **Features**:
  - Speech-related features like pitch, jitter, and shimmer.
  - Medical features like age, gender, and others.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Google Colab** for implementation and running the models.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**:
  - `scikit-learn` for building and evaluating the model.
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization.
- **Other Libraries**: `keras` (if you used deep learning models), `xgboost`, or any other relevant libraries.

## Project Details

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Describe any data cleaning steps, like handling missing values or scaling features.
   - Mention how the data was split into training and testing sets.

### 2. **Model Development**:
   - Explain the machine learning models you used (e.g., logistic regression, SVM, decision trees).
   - If applicable, include deep learning approaches and their architectures.
   - Provide any hyperparameter tuning or cross-validation strategies you employed.

### 3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Describe the performance metrics used (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
   - Show the confusion matrix or classification report, if applicable.
   - Discuss the model's final performance and any insights.

### 4. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarize the results and explain how the model can be used in a real-world scenario.
   - Mention possible future improvements or areas for further exploration.

## Usage

To use the trained model for predictions:
```python
prediction = model.predict(new_data)
